    "Well, the socond solution obviously has several advantages: 1 - assume it works faster as we go through the list only once, and 2 - it's more universal as it will always identify the longest sequence well, when the solution with the dictionary will work properl ONLY if we have one sequence of the same character in the string - once we get a secong e.g. shorter sequence of the same character it will get appended to our character sequence with the corresponding key and thus will spoinl the result. In the second method a minor issue is that we will only return the FIRST longest sequence identified...if there is another sequence of the same length we will never get it out."
